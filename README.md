# Emergency-room-heap

This is a C heap database used to store emergency room patients.

The name and critical status of the patient us entered by the attendant. 

The arrival time is calculated as the time the patient was entered into the system. 

The serial number is generated and assigned. 

This is my first repository on Github. In the near future I would like to add room numbers, next of kin, and other important informaiton as well as develop this same program in Java and C++.
